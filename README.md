# Digital-Signal-Processing-ADC

This script demonstrates the basic steps of converting an analog signal into a digital bitstream:

1. Generate Analog Signal – Create a continuous-like sine wave.
2. Sampling – Discretize the signal using a chosen sampling frequency.
3. Quantization – Approximate sample amplitudes with limited quantization levels.
4. Encoding – Represent quantized values as binary codes.
5. Digital Bitstream – Concatenate binary codes into a serial bitstream.

The script also plots the analog, sampled, and quantized signals for visualization and prints part of the encoded output.
